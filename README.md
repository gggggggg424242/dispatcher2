This is slightly decrypted pyarmor output.  I tried not to make guesses but clean up the output of the code.

Review the "dev" branch for AI generated guesses as to code: https://github.com/whit3rabbit/manus-open/tree/dev

Note that the code probably doesn't work but should be interesting for research.

I have includeded a requirements.txt for building a venv.
